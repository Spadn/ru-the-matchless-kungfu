"d3e4a9defe657b71cb9cba59fb4572b6","You might be wondering why, but the tension between our sects goes way back. Ask around, and you'll understand. Anyway, here's a little something as a welcome gift. That's all for today, haha."

"d9a58466cfa787460ebf1cb5d7076ea2","We're good at using and raising toxin worms. You can get an incubation box from the elders, but it won't come free."

To unlock the sword case's power, we sacrifice weapons to forge spirit swords, which can then be equipped for battle."

"1c95403de8f5fe2ebfb35d0530204b96","You must be the hero the hunter spoke of. Alas, misfortune befell him after you left. He asked me to give you these items if you were ever to return, so that you didn't help him deal with those monkeys for nothing."

"51b4d0ea4b9f4ad62b243703dfb7ebd7","You should watch your words and actions, young one. It's best to treat others with kindness, or you won't know when you might make enemies."

"30f5820ceb7e1a6defb251604e7c8d4d","I'll let it slide. Here's the village. Go find the Clinic and treat your wounds."

"b8940c8ba5f258d5c65184f4b897c003","It won't serve you well to make needless enemies. Even my patience has its limits. Go treat your wounds at the Clinic. Don't be so reckless in the future!"
"9a3aa60039f359d804e9936a6fc9e01b","Thank goodness I was nearby to save you in time."
"5ac3370172c3fe1ec0f5482ef8ea12f6","I was attacked by bandits when I journeyed through the wilds. Fortunately, a master named {0}{1} intervened and saved me from harm. After talking to him, I learned that the former Champion had also suffered from memory loss. Perhaps I could uncover the truth about my origins if I became the Champion? I should ask {0}{1} about sects when I have time."
"d48adcb46e1336fed8c6b347f48469b8","Are you alright?"
"124c92147cf9b4afb05714fd24e296fa","Thank you, good master. Allow me to repay this debt in the future. May I know who I am indebted to?"

"d397e0e3689df754a18f06bf0550d473","Ah, it appears you're unaware of your natural kungfu talent. A one in a million prodigy. I couldn't resist being drawn to your potential. That's why I came to save you. That begins the bond between us."
"93c8d0121f9bb99f66e28ff12f255f02","I wonder if you've heard of memory loss."
"89432e14b3b18a93aa98b1245a27ae77","Indeed I've heard a thing or two about this curious condition in my travels. It's rumored that the former Champion had also been afflicted, but no one knows how they were cured."

"cccc16a24ce75385e9a0c2b1a5c9fece","The mysterious Cargo Ship is connected to a secretive force in the kungfu world. It has far-reaching implications that even Champions would hesitate to speak of. Champions are also related to your memory loss. It seems that you have no other choice but to become the Champion, should you wish to know more."
"1ac90d2d1823e68df5ff6f5ccbf446f0","Guess I have to let it drop, for now."

"2ea3b742695701f7db50b0b204596697","Hahaha, I'm used to a laid-back life. Teaching is not a thing for me. Very likely I'll point you in the wrong path."

"d531c57f9f5c565c84b0d1c172802dbb","Hahaha, alright, alright. I was indeed intrigued by your natural talent. It would be insincere of me to pretend otherwise. I may be able to teach you a few moves, but my learning may not be suitable for you. I do not wish to distort such a fine gem as you. There are many prestigious sects in this world, each with its own profound arts. My knowledge is limited, but I can give you a simple overview of these sects. Feel free to ask me if you're interested. You can then choose a sect that appeals to you."

"fe24b7e81f1c41eb4f91dc20caceb282","I was attacked by bandits when I journeyed through the wilds, but I managed to defeat them. It was not until a master named {0}{1} started clapping that I realized there was someone there. After talking to him, I learned that the former Champion had also suffered from memory loss.

"230b29bbc20fd729783006c1393ea52d","I only dabbled in the basics. It's nothing to boast about."
"2f0fce5619a1734dfcf812f0dd6eab6d","Hahaha, your modesty is commendable. I knew you're meant for greater things. Now that we've met again, I'd like to aid you in your Kungfu training. Name something, and I'd oblige."
"287093301ea47fe605d71b3cc76d957e","Thank you. I'll give it some thought."

"3fa5dfa70c943a24ca8fda730ea3c4d9","Seems they noticed after all. The timing isn't ideal, but when push comes to shove, we have to carry it through."
"2b9d984597441cff23df2688bdb0582b","Master? How come you're here! Did you see what just happened?"
"0b01023e8a48459d1cf535699d8cc63b","We're in the midst of a crisis, so there's no time for catching up. You've raised the alarm of the Venerables. The substitution spell no longer works. I can only appear before you in my true form."
"78b2f8eb667a67168ca02ff21d62f2c1","The substitution spell...it resembles the possession spell of those two Venerables!"
"32f52655340dcb1648ba520c6ac2c520","Hehe, didn't expect you to be so perceptive. I dared not reveal too much before you regained your memories, seeing there's so much at stake. But now, there's no point in keeping this from you any more. I shall tell you everything."
"e8c48e53fcd55701c002dc3f0adeb774","Who are you?"
"ef3db1b78b18f29cd12926632e309a2c","I am the Heavenly Saint. For centuries I've walked the Kungfu world, and honed my skills to perfection. Yet I was felled when defending the beings of these Wilds, stripped to my primordial spirit, having to possess bodies to exist."
"4cc121ccb71c8b110f4076a308aaa632","Who are the Venerables?"
"5c75d6f6d803f4cc36379194b7b6303a","Heh, the so-called Venerables are the most wicked beings to walk this earth. Centuries ago, they founded the Huanmos Temple and used vile means to collect the world's Kungfu Skills, destroying numerous sects in the process. All they wanted was to control the Great Wilds and place the whole world under their tyranny."
"bf297ddf4f846e557ab560386cd3bb0d","Who am I?"
"39ead1b91ab80aa9812813e30be36825","As for you, haha. Hundreds of years ago, there was one who strode the Wilds undefeated. One hailed as a Kungfu legend, the unchallenged champion of the martial arts world. Indignant at the deeds of the Huanmos Temple, the righteous hero set out with his friend to take down Huanmos."
"e4dc119f45886b41b93b62c490ae506b","Would that be... !"
"e47e6c92d875765aff9468569e85b160","Yes. You are the Kungfu legend of yore, the uncrowned lord of the Wilds. And I...I am the Heavenly Saint, the friend who fought alongside you in Huanmos Temple."
"53744097592d37b882fda587551521e3","And what became of that battle?"
"80ea8c8e4c1a19a480d67ec23d75a4e2","We suffered a crushing defeat. Turns out there were a band of Primal Kungfu masters in Huanmos Temple, while on our side, we two were the only ones to reach that realm. Faced with such disparity, you were gravely wounded and fell into a coma, while my body was destroyed, leaving only my primordial spirit."
"30b9070a5195ed9ea569ccd69ead7008","What about the ship? What's the ship about?"
"e5209f4a03926dd4a247ce6460e05d63","That's the Ferry. The Venerables use it to reap the world. Inhabitants of the Wilds offer their valuables. Kungfu experts are ferried to Huanmos Temple, where they are devoured and assimilated, to ensure the Venerable's rule."
"85510b7a08e306ca087efb9870a588d4","Are they aware of their fate?"
"2bbabcfd78a2f428bf9bd174ce14871b","Would that make any difference? You saw what the Venerables are capable of. They have ascended the Primal realm, far beyond the reach of mortals. Their wield a truly terrible power. Whoever dares defy them will be erased from the world, the entire family exterminated."
"a0c81d8cbea217a43113558d32d3177f","Why do they call me Cultivator?"
"0de11805763c81bc0f4a9ecacf9c7738","Hahaha. You cultivate the world, just like a farmer. They brainwash those who defy Huanmos, until they become mere pawns. These pawns surveil the world for them, removing uncertainties and fortifying their rein."
"88bab03e70f2decc5c910468563e61fa","Why did I wake up on the ship?"
"ee413c5f14839aea25dc869d553dc155","After our defeat, I went into hiding, thinking I no longer had the power to defy Huanmos Temple. Little did I expect to see you again, here in the Wilds. Fortunately, you were born with Kungfu talent, and I needed very little effort to summon back your primordial spirit and soul. That's why you were able to learn all these Kungfu skills with ease. After all, you created many of them yourself."
"97b8f2e2664463c9be3887d0a1a78fac","It all makes sense now."
"e5dd9d803624d8636f324b7cb4dbe089","...What do you plan to do next?"
"62b2fae0a1d519ac15dcfcec1f2f5127","It's not about me. It's about both of us!  Should we uproot Huanmos Temple and restore this world to peace and order? Or spend our days in hiding, watching as people suffer."
"3f4dee52bde35c39eb05618cb55b45a3","For the sake of the innocent people, we cannot evade our obligation."
"de3806dfa71316057a7cc8ca4b4e48e2","Haha, exactly the hero I remember! Well said. In this world of ruin, who else can shoulder this obligation, if not us?"
"01fd84134a0b56d983a7ec1f34283705","Tell me what I need to do."
"d90475822f13657a9bac4551d9828065","You need to cross the ocean. Head north and seek the Huanmos Temple realms beyond the sea. They have sharks in the sea. You must be very careful. If you have good Energy, you can use the Qinggong Fly On Water and traverse the sea. If you have enough Vigor, you can try being swallowed by a shark, as it will bring you straight to Huanmos Temple."
"2afc51a4502a0bb23b964d516257a474","Are we going just like this? From what you told me, I'm not what I used to be."
"ab30540f01eff7042bdab4b0c010e426","Of course not, if the Venerables were vigilant. But so used to power they are, they have long ceased to care about worldly affairs. Almost everything is handled by their Huanmos Servants, puppets of Huanmos Temple. They possess powers surpassing mortals, but so predictable they are, it will be possible to take them down with might or wit."
"7dbc3a06de0917309c826d69a80b35ba","Even I am no match for Huanmos Servants, who have surpassed mortals."
"4dbd2299271a146ded97e9055dabd2ce","They are but a bunch of lowly wits. As long as we are careful, we'd be able to divide and conquer. As long as we can open the Heavenly Gate before the Venerables have time to react, we can set free everything they have amassed over the years, with or without form. By then, it will be too late for the Venerables to do anything."
"e4cfa0015b4a500b76cda51c67421593","What's the Heavenly Gate?"
"ca25c17127a125890c78a760f03eeee3","The Huanmos Temple plundered not only rare treasures, but also the Energy of kungfu experts, the souls of martial arts prodigies, your memories, my body. All of these have been locked within a place called the Heavenly Gate."
"acd15796dc30b654fb6624ba8b53f2ae","I never knew a place like this existed."
"813881b9aa68e2229bbbec6ec3854a6e","If I had told you before today that someone could harness the weather and engulf the Wilds, you probably wouldn't have believed me."
"33d6e1ca55560b274f7eca6c63b54e70","That's amazing."
"305938135f92ca433053de3aa1224e2c","Very well, the decision is up to you. No matter what your choice is, know that I'll have your back. Farewell..."
"09ac030d1a0d8c331cc766ae89ec6fe2","Even if I don't stand up against them, I don't think they'll let it pass."
"366247b0f6d921cd198d9ec4df2b60f8","Such an ominous aura. Who are you again?"
"affee6573de78ea7d5530491b7318746","I'm [Yuwen]. You don't recognize me in this form?"

"62cc1e59d023d9a282b3bdf7d1529373","Radiance, what's unfolding today is meant to teach you that everything has its preordained destiny! You took control of the Heaven Realm, closing the Heavenly Gate and isolating the Three Realms. Did you ever envision this reunion? !"
"74c54c01e4924f213b75e475aebd1d48","So, it was you who manipulated the cultivator. No wonder even I was misled, thinking he had simply gone astray. Cultivator, do you realize that your momentary confusion will bring great disaster to all living beings?"
"b1d9e7eba80afa14870f910b32a81d8a","After today, sentient beings will lose their order. The cycles of prosperity and decline, birth and death, will be disrupted. Because of you, the primordial spirits of all beings will fall into chaos!"
"5c88131a2a26d5b91d524df599ff572c","Don't pay heed to his nonsense! What you did was in harmony with heavenly will, to save the beings of the Three Realms from control! The foundation of this world extends across three thousand realms, where life should naturally cycle between birth and death. Yet, you so-called deities have disrupted the cycle, upsetting the balance of heaven and earth!"
"380168e9318296864ce8811ec0304a9b","Calamity, we've reached this point, why continue to hide? Reveal yourself!"
"a3d9238a1ff8f7ba8179aff1006913ff","Hehe, in another place, I might fear you to some extent, but in here, what can you possibly do to me?"
"2b9198126850c5554e7fa13acc82bb7d","Calamity, is that your name? Have you been deceiving me all this time?"
"a8ee9cbc7baf2aa178cd566709aeb70a","My true name is Calamity, the Moonlight, and I represent the shadow of all beings. The Silent Raven was crafted by my messenger, the Pursuer of Light. Although there was some deception, everything I'm saying now is undoubtedly true. You are indeed the hero who saved the beings of the Three Realms."
"0c23e0be28164dbdc21ee3441897ba8c","You manipulated me?"
"9d301711783d45dc51cf4d65fcbce253","To say I manipulated you might be an overstatement. You once asked who I really am. Well, now I'll tell you. You're just a cultivator, a pawn under Radiance's command, tasked with cultivating. At the beginning of each world, Radiance sends cultivators like you to nurture living beings. However, when it's time for the harvest, it also marks your own end."
"df3305f803f47613cded0653f1b5ea84","Do you expect me to believe you?"
"addb5b89dd41384648504de166873915","Hehe, whether you believe it or not, I may have utilized you, but I also empowered you.  Now, you've broken free from Radiance's control, transcended the Three Realms, and exist beyond the Five Elements. From now on, no one can truly bring about your demise. You will be immortal, just like us."
"6f0c57cbfacfd8aaf4d736df798eb310","He didn't actually deceive you, but the situation isn't beyond repair. This world is out of my control. With your current abilities, if you're willing to restore order, you can become a deity once order is reestablished.  And this world will also serve as your personal domain, and you can do as you please. What do you say?"
"2bff58d82c93167b2a2623d4365d59f7","Hahaha, Radiance, don't tell me you've run out of cards to play? Listen, this world exists beyond his grasp. Even if you don't cooperate with him, you're the ruler here! Life, death, aging, and sickness—all of it now depends on your whim! Why not join me and purge those who have haughtily governed it from the Heaven Realm for countless ages? Let's establish genuine fairness and order!"
"6f03f98e50b5404f9b63ac816228bb0b","Calamity, you fooled me once, but you won't pull that off a second time."
"3162663ce058c2d98c70a9c63d44daf1","Calamity, your elaborate schemes amounted to nothing. Cultivator, no, I should now call you the Sage. Come, let's jointly establish order and govern the Three Realms. I'll be awaiting you in the upper realm."
"020ac259a25fda94c245e4133d8a32b9","In due time, the heaven and earth will be restored to their rightful order."
"588d735a6a50e9ac9b11030f9802fe92","As I step into the martial world, regrets will be a thing of the past, and our destinies shall intertwine once more."

"cce485b93f0bac61594a80b68e7f02e3","I never expected the Heavenly Saint, or rather, Calamity, to deceive me and lead to a grave mistake. Luckily, the damage was minimal, and Radiance's timely intervention brought everything under control.  This world is now under my dominion, and I'll await Radiance to fulfill our pact and take me to the Heaven Realm."
"d5119b369e55a7d19289e190ea5e4e82","Invading the Heaven Realm? That sounds quite intriguing."
"e7ca90e47f6d266e7565187a8ad33d46","Radiance, your meticulous manipulation of primordial spirits and disruption of the rules has all come to naught. Cultivator, no, I should now call you the Sage. Come, let us dismantle this chaotic world together. I'll be waiting for you in the Heaven Realm."
"fff6940d1d333b5cbe7e5a2cee7ce128","Even though Calamity deceived me, the initial aim of saving the Three Realms was not mistaken. Invading the Heaven Realm? Calamity, that's a rather intriguing proposal! Witnessing those rule makers begging for mercy on their knees should provide me with great satisfaction. "
"5a17656c7ba1934ce1ca76130869c734","If we can truly liberate the Three Realms, what does it matter if it costs a lifetime of battles?"

"845baf42b76cb2d6ee76ea840c63b0b7","The heavenly order is not to be trifled with. This is merely one world breaking free from control. How much influence can you truly exert on the Three Realms all on your own? Cultivator, no, I should call you the Sage now. I eagerly anticipate our next encounter."
"5a9aaffae269464ae114773f00a4a37d","Hahaha, you, young one, truly amuse me. Go cultivate. I'm in your debt for the Heavenly Gate. When the time comes in the Heaven Realm, we'll settle this score between us."
"a476747e426bd031f87b2d2c038a25fb","I've transcended the Three Realms, now existing beyond the Five Elements, having become an immortal presence akin to Radiance and Calamity. Why should I concern myself with the conflict between them? Throughout the Three Realms, no one shall stand above or dominate me any longer!"
"12eb1f652bb680bcf4117da014e8419b","I shan't be under anyone's control, merely following my own path as I see fit."

"be7ed8ce9db78f67e685096218396266","I'm recovering well. I see you're agile, you must also be a martial artist. May I ask which sect you're from? And why were you nearly killed that day, was it a vendetta or something else?"

"5034aa3553a5a324a1ae16fcec152319","It's quite a coincidence. I happened to pass by Longting Six Li and saw you covered in blood, unconscious. There was an empty house nearby, so I brought you here and used my skills to heal you."
"d064ce39d38c0761b142ab40a39963d0","No need for thanks. You had a good foundation. I just stopped the bleeding. It was no big deal. What are your plans for the future?"

"fa704455d402ef201a5e198b1e546bd6","Well, that's understandable. With such a vast world and your memory gone, it's natural to feel lost for a while."

"2da603c87f871a1bd3479b57965c3e96","You kept mentioning Longquan Town while you were unconscious. If you have no other ideas, maybe you could go to Longquan Town. You might find something there."
"a881a08fe3e50470a28ee30f67033b4b","Longquan Town...Thank you."
"49219b6b9bb4dabffc7e71410ccbba82","In the martial world, meeting is fate. No need for thanks. But since you've forgotten a lot, I wonder how much of your martial arts skills you still have."

"c50af253e15978f384f0503b9ec07d3a","Good, but martial arts combat isn't rigid. It's not just exchanging blows. The most basic method is to use both punches and kicks simultaneously. And using two different moves at the same time is called 'hanging moves.'"
"ec983a371b0b17c8e919e42ebc2b01fd","Got it."
"df56793aef538f621950861e90110c5c","Very good. Once you learn how to hang moves, you can try using combos."

"279c6ecf56ff0dd05db3b2215de77e3d","A combo is triggered when you use four identical moves simultaneously. You'll immediately get a move that triggers the combo."

"9097aef7b851e3702b74e77b48d9dc8f","Not only that, by releasing moves to activate skills, you'll truly step into the martial world."

"3430d84ab83b2167d4cc7de253d286a6","This place is desolate, so it's inevitable that some wild animals are starving and looking for trouble. It's just right. You can use what you've learned to teach it a lesson."

"9f84919536ba3945e7c8e21e69d3ea2e","Finally, there is the 'guard' technique. Guarding a move means keeping a move at a guard node, so in the next round, you can still retain this move to increase the maximum number of moves you can execute."

"520dad78ab5d24550bd97e21b96f3c34","In a short time, you've already mastered everything. It seems you have some background. Although this wild wolf is not worth mentioning, fighting it is a good way to clear the stagnant blood in your body after lying in bed for a long time. It's quite clever."

All skill releases require a certain amount of internal energy. At the same time, internal energy also increases your defense. The more internal energy you have left, the stronger your defense. You've depleted quite a bit in the recent fight, so now focus your mind and I'll teach you how to meditate to restore your internal energy."

"5790f7c8f67f84471045dd2636ad6051","I've finally made it to Dragonspring Town. What kind of past am I trying to uncover? Why can I defy death and return to life again and again? Yan Xiaosheng, what do you know? There's something hidden within me... some kind of secret. The tavern is usually the best place to gather information. Maybe the Tavern Manager knows something. I should ask around."
"4266021af6bedcc9c545082591d58a41","The Tavern Manager said that years ago, Yan Xiaosheng brought back a person, covered in blood, from the Dragonspring battlefield."
"d343d015ef3f2cb3201e684c87397448","Could that person have been... me?"
"88ca79bb925842f4fb1f90db1375b22e","A once-powerful emperor who ruled the martial world. An assassin's guild that dared to strike down the emperor. A person drenched in blood..."
"0d881e271fc5445be4df40b0f6a143e9","The more I uncover, the deeper the mystery becomes."
"dba8826433d22c807558c7f3b6ba3e36","It's clear I carry something important—something worth saving. Otherwise, why would Yan Xiaosheng have saved me? If we were close, wouldn't he have told me when I first woke up? It feels more like there's something he wants from me... or perhaps something both the grand emperor and the Silent Raven want."
"1a2f92132f7a811842145fa72c5bdbbd","And those assassins—they could have been hired because of me. Still, I don't fully understand who I am. The grand emperor lived over a hundred years ago. The assassination was also long ago. Was I even involved back then?"
"7d7be5266c11368c9f2370d63eea0d8c","For now, I can't be sure."
"d5c6740f63276597cdd06da7188d776b","It's all just speculation..."
"2daec78e960a6829f7dc05d71066f6dc","I didn't find any clear answers about my identity in Dragonspring Town. Should I keep searching for my past, or just focus on surviving the present?"
"f5fa0e97f2d113a98c945d07d46b985f","One step at a time."
"70e87f8717d0edaf5a4c8196c564b04c","Black Sparrow"
"6e453d094299ca1c9935281e6b250d31","Killer"
"68a1fad083bfe89ec940721df48b8268","At that moment, the sound of fighting erupts near the town gates. I should check it out."
"b837f990aeb7435490d429622af470f1","Hum? There's fighting at the gates. Let's go see what's happening."
"8f618504d283f87fe419097e38e754ec","Sound of Fighting"
"0b3e65d3a87faaec81aaaeb8f9e3b1ed","You've arrived in Dragonspring Town, still no closer to discovering who you are. Just as you're lost in thought, a commotion breaks out at the town gates. Time to investigate."
"12ed177a6e48eda0e3e695311422c067","Head to the Dragonspring Town gates to check out the situation"
"bd3d3b639f55b6230e9f4fb805d22997","Is that... him? Yan Xiaosheng? He's the one who sent me to Dragonspring Town. Could it really be him?"
"c4261f3e11cc71a8a7acd8005ec1c211","I'll wait and see how this plays out."
"81500528cb4ba5bbe4fede7910b9ecb3","Yan Xiaosheng, your end is near! You've been aiding evil for far too long!"
"4a1a6378692b24a6407c039a9b27669d","Broad daylight, and you dare commit murder in the streets? You assassins are bold, but don't think you're any match for me."
"733498be5c505c5d96bd749efe52a404","Hmph, we normally couldn't beat you, but you're severely poisoned. We will take you down today!"
"07caf0db32a8e12af70045f3657f7cd3","You notice Yan Xiaosheng's face is dark—he's clearly been poisoned!"
"e2adc992f4d07fcdcb21003047beb0a4","(Poisoned?)"
"b0a18385154c3505a860e3604fded1d1","Ugh! When did this happen?!"
"9094d40f68ba57de95f6b9f789e8e94d","Did you really think you could escape our poison just because you know a bit about our organization? Traitor! Today, you'll pay for your betrayal!"
"354d54a61e9088485e147be859eab607","(Yan Xiaosheng holds the key to my past. I can't let him die here.)"
"858224b5a105c2bfe6b1c8cd5ee4d943","[Help] Stop!"
"9b09ead9d254b5352aa4ae3db9d34da4","Cough... You? Get out of here, quickly!"
"1e951869197b37885c2d6f177cac7910","[Help] I'm not leaving you behind!"
"689c6e3a2d45c773640048149350c320","Hmph. Where did this fool come from? Kill them too!"
"ced77a1cc6997699813dd587be004265","Prepare to fight!"
"91517afa5f10a112abb0b0e9ffc9b2d4","Phew..."
"7730812bda8b63b3673544636c5633cc","How... how can this be? Who are you?!"
"fbd847e5a4b65f480e6c30d24717f46f","Before you can answer, Yan Xiaosheng, though severely poisoned just moments ago, suddenly strikes, killing the two assassins with swift, deadly blows."
"c7cd741916e9b2ba662900cdd7866367","Why are you here?"
"9602ccbf81a664b8b8ff78a5f8490e3d","From your expression, it seems you've started to understand."
"a4c77ccdd0976e59a453b772eaef3757","What really happened in Dragonspring Town all those years ago? The blood-covered person from back then... that was me, wasn't it?"
"92650d2166546d9ad39b0807266c50a2","Is this what you wanted me to discover?"
"6d5e5c2de6068d9717d4b76879a1d1b8","Some things are inevitable. Back then, your meridians were destroyed, and you were on the brink of death. I intended to bury you in the Six-Mile Longting."
"3647d6989d6a4c336d9d7f702f9db654","But, against all odds, you survived. And not only did you recover, but your meridians and bones healed completely. Three years ago, your injuries were fully healed, but you remained in a coma... until that day."
"0d012ea4f1ce4c0a73ac89b7ac49e60a","That day...?"
"17cddf5ceb0a2ef4dc92694c151c3d22","Yes, you woke up, but you lost all your memories. At the time, I thought losing them might be a blessing. It would keep you out of the turmoil of the martial world."
"4fda164e7db1e73d2f255f38192db9e1","Then why did you send me here?"
"396196ad15f0efc47847a0d7d5d404b5","As an old friend, I understood your heart. I didn't want you to get pulled back into the chaos, but I also didn't want you to live aimlessly. Coming to Dragonspring Town or not —it was your choice to make."
"2d8555a8cfa100c31de6eb466f6630a2","You gave me a goal when I was lost, and now you say it was all my choice? So much for letting me choose."
"86d51ce7753a36079041fc15f7248035","Heh."
"54eb432d4f079cfe1b09adfaefb1265d","Believe what you will, but as soon as I entered Dragonspring Town, I knew something was wrong. It didn't take long for me to encounter these assassins from the Silent Raven."
"a2c629148ab8b14033bbb1c1085a6d6f","Why are they after you?"
"e673f09eaf6eff9e24bfaa7b40194599","I overheard them calling you a traitor."
"c5256c9d091e1d024d3aa0c10047ee7b","It's no secret. I was once a member of the Silent Raven. And I was your closest friend. In the end, I chose you over them. That's why they call me a traitor."
"7d07245171b8177fe273008b788e1ee9","At first, I wasn't sure why both the Grand Emperor and the Silent Raven were so desperate to find you. But when I saw how quickly you recovered from your injuries, I knew you were hiding a great secret."
"3cc92c36631d4b51eb827f6396a00089","You don't know what that secret is?"
"5e8633e141295c9b7a5058c19e30576a","You don't have to be so suspicious of me. If I really wanted to deceive you, I would've done it the moment you woke up. Why bother with this elaborate plan?"
"ab445835cdc1a76a4290d3ebb76b2e43","I'm still not sure why these two powerful forces are after you... but now you should find a safe place to hide."
"223b3aa9cca6b8a32854f5a0848325eb","Where can I hide?"
"773ab4a289dbafff1a035981f50348e9","The world is vast. If you find a remote place to disappear, you can avoid them."
"b412c407716eaa230d22e87675ba9ef7","Why should I hide?"
"48d9f084753ffe0ec77bb896afce2da3","I almost forgot—you've lost your memory of the Silent Raven. Once they target someone, they will stop at nothing until the job is done. Even if their employer dies, they will continue until they've fulfilled their contract."
"beeffb61f9eee3c8d9773bc239ec9b3e","How do you think you can avoid them? There's no way to defend against their kind. I was once part of them, so I know their methods well. I fell into their trap today, and if it weren't for you stepping in, I'd be dead by now. How do you expect to escape their grasp?"
"54b40625b2f3f8120f39e8b4333f6d3f","So, no matter where I go, they'll eventually find me? I can't live in fear forever."
"54cacec3d27ce7e421b2bcee4253dcf4","Do you really think I can avoid them?"
"b28fba39e8742d19c926a1ee70e71863","Are you planning to take the fight to them? Back then, your martial arts were extraordinary, almost unrivaled. Even so, you nearly died. With your current skills... you're no match for them."
"982fdf22a78e83a4cc2e90604f20c211","Yan Xiaosheng sees your determination, then pauses, speaking softly."
"5f60b5a7040933cc434ee138c03bd208","Is there really no way out?"
"c7a43e353afcd61b815067562f0d3e60","Not entirely hopeless."
"fc2b0728bd592c786bbb20f8e3462ac4","What do you have in mind?"
"ca2cdc21fbb602eaad3b2af059ecffef","The Silent Raven has informants all over the martial world, but they were still suppressed. If it hadn't been for the Grand Emperor's guard being spread thin, the Silent Raven wouldn't have succeeded."
"01256b736cfb9633687fac642778ed2a","Nowadays, the only force with that kind of influence is the new rule set by the major sects after the Northern Invasion."
"94e335fa79adc89532cc847ebef4dafc","New rule?"
"898e92f231995894d1d15c41bf690e10","Back then, the Grand Emperor's martial prowess was unmatched, and no one dared defy him. After he vanished, the central lands were thrown into chaos. The remaining sects, to avoid repeating such disaster, agreed to hold a grand competition every five years. The Champion becomes the martial world's new leader."
"feaa3ad5e1f25a3e705163bab5ae18ed","And you think this leader can stand up to the Silent Raven?"
"d6ce97471a8cc0147431d8e13ce03c90","Martial leader?"
"8f559be370d6be710214f71866eee365","The Champion, with all the sects behind them, commands considerable authority. While some sects might defy them in secret, the Silent Raven is a common enemy. Besides, after their battle with the Grand Emperor, they're not as powerful as they once were. Otherwise, they wouldn't be sending weaklings like those after me."
"ad5f98b0aaab25c71b6578401a2f167e","You could always hide somewhere."
"e3bdc14ca42bc3374e6bcae7754dcf92","Seems like that might be my only option."
"11c1040a1aeb4b1fa05c84c54994305a","The Champion is decided through the Kungfu Contest—a competition of skill, not a fight to the death."
"4bf2158f94e5965d2677ed37bb40a796","How do I become the Champion?"
"520c2063f432113b1f3cf2aaac2ed1d3","Where is the contest held?"
"5f845f720e8b6df9c680ff2ee7508e11","The contest has a specific location, but you'll only be informed if you're eligible to participate."
"a760e6f0ed38047e2ff13e855be1e7cc","When is the next contest?"
"bce45a8b691707bbdc88ba990392c891","It's held every five years, but the date hasn't been set yet. You still have time to hone your skills and prepare."
"c70e858d574dc7a2eb34a46fef4f9073","How do I enter the Kungfu Contest?"
"02ca9c9eeb65fd6c2c3cf2664d5d8728","It's an agreement among the major sects, so you must either join a sect or start your own to enter. Only elders or higher-ranked members can participate.\\nIf you want to start your own sect, keep in mind that it needs at least 30 members to qualify."
"b998a09d725186e0a53a3c93bda65fd3","Do I have to be an elder?"
"5312a0d0373be7ba014200f4f18b7fe0","Well, if the sect has fewer than 16 members, they may select top indoor disciples to participate, but that rarely happens. You don't want to rely on that. So it mostly comes down to experience."
"417a5f50f2c95e93dfb144c7fc3ca695","I see."
"f2cfce4d76dffbd20c09ef45fc393260","What are you thinking?"
"e8e2c377557b95d46bb002049a2d4d14","I still have questions for you."
"12ebac1b050147c241461431cd7ba35d","Questions for me?"
"46a229ea376ca967610c9a449bc61e7b","You were heavily poisoned earlier—barely able to move. How did you suddenly recover and kill those two?"
"dee6bd6e315dc82b76026c29e728ca48","About the poison"
"53d0a2e934f7f16f64aa0333f7ad1f3b","Why didn't they drag me back for questioning, or wait until the poison fully took effect? Attacking in broad daylight—weren't they afraid something would go wrong?"
"745d9198f83fac9bcdbc1b0fff7a55e6","It's partly the Silent Raven's nature, but also, I used to serve them. I'm highly familiar with their poisons. These drugs only work on me temporarily, and that's why they rushed their attack, knowing they didn't have much time."
"870a5aa87e2e3ed96f99ce219fbe7f46","I've decided to enter the Kungfu Contest."
"ef7f85af77ecea7d014bd367b39cf4cd","I won't stop you, but remember—the Silent Raven has influence everywhere. Their true strength is unknown. If you choose this path, it'll be riddled with danger. You might not even live long enough to qualify for the contest before they kill you."
"c5e830564d222513855765bee15c139b","Was I ever the type to be cowardly and afraid of trouble?"
"5686eab410e15251ff2a054fe16e49f2","You're still the same as ever. Very well, I won't stop you. I was going to recommend some sects for you to join, but given my situation, traveling together would only make things riskier for you."
"73685db393cc99a5cf62fb8ebce1619e","With the upcoming contest, many martial artists are gathering in here. Take a look around. You'll likely encounter quite a few. Whether or not you can gain entry to a sect and secure your spot in the contest, though—that's up to you."
"9d26f7758c8e76f971891ae559cb2fff","Can you introduce the major sects?"
"1c955bddaeadeae13f95ef026ce6829c","Ah, I almost forgot! Though I can't help you join any of these sects, I can certainly tell you a bit about them as a reference."
"b1354d061204b794af572c5aa8dc7751","In the past, the martial world was ruled by six powerful sects, each with their own unique skills, standing as the undisputed leaders under the imperial court. However, after the northern invasion, these six sects were the first to bear the brunt of the attacks, suffering heavy losses. They each sealed their gates and disappeared without a trace."
"a18a993c8ed4846ecd7eb96f842fe6b6","Now, eight emerging sects have taken their place. Though new, these sects have deep connections to the old powers."
"ca81f6098589f8c56625a398f18f7610","The eight sects are as follows:\\nOro Sword Sect on Mount Beimang,\\nMillibeast Sect on Mount Millibeast,\\nDrunken Immortal's Parlor by Drunken Immortal Lake,\\nBamboo Pond Sect by Bamboo Pond,\\nFire God Vale in Rubycliff Ravine,\\nNethershade Cult in Shadowy Gorge,\\nFive-dragon Cult in Dragon Ridge Valley\\nSeance in Nine Wolves Burrow.\\nSo, which one would you like to know more about?"
"aa7d9e50d65b192441726576a9cc6d01","Oro Sword Sect"
"91dac513b8df66e4764d40ea8962058b","Oro Sword Sect is situated atop Mount Beimang, surrounded by snow all year round. They specialize in frost-based energy, mastering both sword and palm techniques.\\nFounded by the third-place winner of the Heavenly Pool Sword Conference, their Arctic Palm and Snow-melting Sword skills are renowned.\\nAs for why they didn't win? That year, two unmatched swordsmen were competing."
"522b90a710b62b7e7021543f1d4bf2ad","Fire God Vale"
"29d39be377013a6bb3284458fc176b24","Fire God Vale, located in Rubycliff Ravine, specializes in flame-based energy and excels in blade and palm techniques. The sect's founder, once a senior figure in the Skyforge Pavilion, left over ideological differences. Their Sky-Heating Saber style is unmatched, and they've since dominated the smithing trade. If you're into forging weapons, this is the place to go."
"b4fa5bfcd3696c04ff8fc42c30d76e85","Bamboo Pond"
"f6bab1d98e9a0ca8328e375dd8a22773","The sect shares its name with its home, Bamboo Pond. Though the founder wasn't creative with names, their concealed weapon techniques are extraordinary,\\ncapable of overwhelming foes. The previous sect master won the last Kungfu Contest but later vanished.\\nHis disciple Huan Changsheng is a rising talent—if you meet him, it could be worth forming a connection."
"e2e74bcc12b8a5816f3403e57d5610ab","Millibeast Sect"
"1981a9311afe6afe96b179ca98ac4c85","Millibeast Sect's founder could naturally speak with animals, creating a unique style from fist arts. They made a name for themselves in the first Kungfu Contest,\\nand their mastery of taming and training beasts remains unmatched."
"ce0e252ddb30d43e2370b66987c15ce6","Drunken Immortal's Parlor"
"90b60ee82f81c1af519b0ee1d7104aba","Drunken Immortal's Parlor started as a simple tavern but grew into a major force after mastering drunken-style martial arts.\\nIts members are carefree and skilled, and the sect is famous for its secret brews that produce some of the finest wines in the martial world. Their former head was a legendary figure, often mentioned alongside the top heroes of the north and south."
"dca1292bf51a23df5aa3fab4673b7e3e","Five-dragon Cult"
"3dcc6b9623fa10b8356c5c90f4a3155e","Five-dragon Cult came from the tribal region and is known for controlling toxin insects,\\nwhich can manipulate minds—a dangerous art. But they've had ongoing conflicts with the Nethershade Cult.\\nMastering their toxin techniques could pave the way to becoming a martial world Champion."
"1cdec20fdb976364df5fb03d237259ef","Seance"
"d1c61da4bbd1baa89a47dc66ed5f384d","I'd avoid dealing with these folks if possible. They seem nice, but they're obsessed with gods and spirits, claiming divine forces control the world. Ridiculous, right? Still, their ability to manipulate fate with strange methods is unsettling.\\nI don't buy into their beliefs, but their fortune-telling skills are surprisingly accurate and might be worth a try."
"9498ed3c293a4f3aa895c50f977fffe8","Nethershade Cult"
"e7531645cedf821730575062f3ae0cf3","Nethershade Cult used to be called Medicine Valley, but they renamed it to sound tougher. Though they're healers at heart, they've gained a dark reputation. Their disciples master both poisons and cures, using toxic techniques in battle while still able to heal. Lately, rumors suggest they've been experimenting on people, so tread carefully around them."
"81d733eb7a1a0792a3b0070b13701b06","About the old six sects"

"f7a325f18871596210398a1db3802bf2","Hard to say. You seem ordinary, unremarkable. Just as you were back then."
"9e4c18e912c524cca5745a3b440d69d0","But I know you're anything but ordinary. Is it soul transfer? Or some other technique? You should have died from those injuries. Yet here you are—new body, new face, walking the earth once more."
"3a10e5d5bdd6c617326cdc0b6ad93f39","Back then, shifu chose to fight the Imperial Counselor to the death, nearly destroying our entire organization, just to snatch you from that place."

"289f41b2338bd0326495b285765cae11","Oh, one more thing. I find you quite intriguing, and I did just want a chat. But the other assassins don't share my sentiment. They say Lin'an City will be your grave. Think you can survive?"
"712b44cf1e4eb85cc2df2d537fae4fd9","Or will you use that mysterious power to change your face and start anew?"

Don’t you smell: \\n, a single knife is pressed for green forests, \\n shakes his head a son to settle. \\n has no opponent of darts, \\ngly covering the first person of Wu Lin. \\n When my old head of Zhuxiangtan was alive, the Lord of the Wulin League also gave him three thin noodles.

"822c199f41f6cca7587b03207c00d5e5","You beat me fair and square. Do as you please. I'd be a coward to give you another excuse."
"cd3d6eb3a48a664bfa7d0054c5595509","You sense the person is clearly injured. His story differs from what you heard at Bamboo Pond. Something seems amiss."
"e6753215f231748e55f9508e560900a7","Now will you listen to me?"
"2274c371d5ebcff3fffccb7f448ed476","Heh. What's the show for?"
"026f59538ac2542c07682ec78938af22","What were you doing there that day?"
"7c5caaa65f183775931231f1437524f0","I'll tell you then. I saw a shadow slip past my bed, so I gave chase, and ended up outside the Master's hall. A concealed weapon barely missed me, just before the Master stepped out the door. We bumped right into each other."
"2b4656535783e2925b7612dafab19d5c","If what you said is true, the culprit deliberately lured you out to frame you."
"3ba24e7ecdc5a2f8ec9b05d0b4fce793","You're saying they're only seeking me to investigate this?"
"09db5fd5971378dd72648aaf2623c9ac","Haha! Why else would I seek you out? His palm struck hard, and he thought he succeeded. So he spoke your name. But he didn't expect me to escape and find you."
"00fcc8782fb317969cc6be292a231be8","I don't know who attacked you, but why not kill you with weapons?"
"e6a47f0ceb271104f5fc029971f74b5a","What's more, if he truly wanted to clean house, there was no need to name me at all."
"c05470f36fb1cd973ef38cc00b5f6600","You see his expression change, clearly persuaded by your words."
"28650e6185b05271b5f6bb76a6266c44","Letting you go intentionally to pit us against each other... What a wicked plot!"
"1596f61628bfa5d8b4ac390b320eef82","How did you get away?"
"458e7bff33dbc88dec6db7be1733c56a","When I went out today, a fellow disciple sought me out and said the Master summoned me to the Hall. But halfway there, he suddenly struck me from behind with his palm. I used that force to fly back and barely escaped."
"13ad75ae761bfb8b317dfb6fb81b5121","Looks like he's your equal in skill. After injuring you, he could only let you flee."
"fef1650ea51edd08e5c3afb790f03e8f","But if you're evenly matched, why not give chase when you fled?"
"e3ac1b70a14d14863b2a3ca67d1cb165","You were injured. Even if you have supreme Qinggong, he should have relentlessly chased you down. Why would he let you go?"
"8a19b05e22244a86dd3633db8a899fcc","Looks like we were both played for fools."
"d0a490fe9d3408580fa8b3aa508cbbc3","Do you mean...?!"
"492f58b1d5675590737590331314a2d1","Indeed, there's something amiss about the affair at Bamboo Pond. I, the borrowed knife. You, the scapegoat."
"c2e7e872e36b53b5d67d4f547cfb7f34","If that's the case, this is a conspiracy that targets not just the Master, but also the entire Bamboo Pond! Framing me as a traitor and expelling me will put the sect at ease, lowering their guard!"
"24277860cab13190ddb105d19ab1a78f","Exactly. Looks like you're not stupid after all."
"85c2e3114f0931ea3120dcf8b712603e","What should we do now?"
"547dc56901e21e98419b9d8539caa125","The first option is to return to Bamboo Pond, find the clues, and confront the mastermind. Stand tall! The second option is to let it pass. The conspirators clearly are scheming against the Bamboo Pond. If we run far enough, never to set step into Bamboo Pond again, we'll probably leave unscathed. Lie low!"
"94ddb02adb7189bb973dae0dcd923f0e","There two options before us."
"e8e824f2b313a6986b6a1e5d0eebc3c2","We're in the same boat. If it hadn't been for you, I would have still been fooled. I trust your judgment."
"688d446e95ca0859fba7f305bc5804bc","... (What should I do? )"
"bd8c703e728485932ea2a6c9c9e3ea89","The first choice. I'm no man's pawn. This isn't over yet."
"11b42aa5e5c8ee1d4c789bc67975dcf0","What should we do? I'll follow your lead."
"1859316f54419d069eee4a39392e9560","If I return, the conspirator will only react in two ways. One - he thinks you're dead. By eliminating me, he can tie up all loose ends."
"b06a8202735c015a809e15cb94d64482","I'll go back alone."
"ccbd404ab99a28880dacc1f1a43ee2c0","Two - they think you're still alive. You haven't sought me out yet, or haven't confronted me for other reasons. In this case, he'll be more cautious, as he doesn't know what's up with you."
"65e13b16c24e521a9b55a745c951832c","What do you mean by that?"
"65b0c6a3c579a6668a76b20808db5329","I'll need to borrow your head."
"72680cbf7c8e232dd4adbe63bea39da0","What? !"
"6b44093d70e0bc7164caf437bd60f57e","We'll just spread fabricated news! He won't take our word for it, but he'll send men to verify the intel. Give me something of yours as proof. Let him see for himself. It'll be more convincing than the rumors we spread."
"c3dc3ad22318a52a2a56b96e0f5123e6","Relax. I don't really want you dead!"
"85efedced58599bb0955c1ef3db6ba58","In that case, he'll come after you for sure."
"f30b01ce5a07c02c307e70932435b6f5","We'll strike together and take him down. Then, we'll expose everything."
"684d18ad99cb757f6949c8d6aa5489ab","What if the conspirator bites back?"
"885fec86cdfbe12837ae3761bdca58f7","You're a disciple of Bamboo Pond. Do your Master a favor and toss a concealed weapon at his room."
"66063ea31c54dc75b0c76145dd714718","Brilliant! When do we make our move?"
"22f45e4e9fcee4f89d824e66c789e323","Give me the item. When I go to Bamboo Pond, the conspirator will have his eyes on me. You stay hidden and wait for the right moment to act."
"52a6a0a2934a18b2c3a2eea04fe9dcd4","Understood. Take care."
"9d78e061302a4c3c39b7c6a15482bb56","Leave it to me."
"886ad375d1cb4b22daf5db4ab6c022b1","? ? ? Broken Bowl? ? ?"
"9794685d33717a9f99ce94bf3edcbefa","I grew up an orphan. Without this broken bowl, I wouldn't have lived to become the old Master's disciple."
"a5b61f2ebd098c3e6b1a73b069e37ce1","...Alright. A unique token, I suppose."
"cf50565995028a0c4668db7a8b95166a","The second option is to escape. The Kungfu world is perilous. We can steer clear of trouble, somewhere far away."
"b93430eab45d3692c14cfb816109862f","But where?"
"2f801b158e80be47114147b3a3b9b1c6","The world is a vast place. Wherever we go, we can find home. Come with me. What do you say?"
"294770513e0d3222af4030959a5a7f78","Now that we're both caught up in this, we're in the same boat. I'll follow you, wherever you go."
"7f8bd3d8aa0f69fb814e6cbfec97e016","I'm used to journeying alone. A long road lies ahead - until we meet again."
"73751b8bdf2768c058e6969933b1188d","What? But then..."
"029a6b73f08575f1e2211b3448e9ec94","Alas. What lies ahead for me?"
"323a7ea4e76bf1b04fca9da096617a1e","Farewell!"
"29e376d73dcf963be2e4fabdd7d42443","Well, safety in numbers, I guess. I just hope the conspirators won't track us down."
"dac09b4ba293d78a10637f8863880069","Let's look out for each other then."
"10f99b76e1f4859926d86aed8581e6e2","Come with me."
"181f679abc7308393766ebdb22d45539","Well, there's a third option. Step in there and muddy the waters!"
"9e1a0974c48e6da6d0d27f99c1c54620","Transfiguration Route. Block first."
"82935ac400bfd92301655c57abab7c8c","Bamboo Pond's traitor. Death is too light a sentence."
"1c50a6fbaed4a24a1c099c875ade43d0","Hahaha. How long do you think you'll last, aiding evil? !"
"41097466be2c24938b0f52c8063d75c6","In any case, I'll outlast you, for sure."
"92d030363f3fecda6c837624a302362d","Hmph! In defeat you still dare speak, scum?"
"a7f00615de00a778097ded6dce6db6c5","The man loathes you. Now that you've lost to him, things look bleak."
"d043583a4b0459739c7a8196f7bec78c","I have nothing to do with your affairs."
"4297c4bfe1668bf6c7c3712862a0452b","Still trying to talk your way out? Despicable."
"1287b2bd0a94451c1f58adeda1f88b57","There's no grudge between us. Why would I frame you?"
"63333299db598f2c3e279a1e469962d3","That's my line! There's no grudge between us. Why are you framing me?"
"6550834c69491c6a9c921d122d91d10f","(Recount events)"
"3b67021efc50d673467c679076f3911a","You're saying that I'm the one who wronged you?"
"c80ea66d5dfe1673c99491ab678bfdcd","Exactly! (Assert firmly)"
"fe4c4e9e31a5955ffa8e3967f09cd608","I'm not deceived by your smooth tongue. I'm blinding you today, so you won't trifle with me again, scum!"

"b72149a5414d9b64ed8fb6fe3737e1bf","Endure for now. Vengeance will come. "
"e6ac0523679c3f46f7fb2419d0b275fd","That's about what happened. (Speak tactfully)"
"c9a69fe76c07c08ae09dac2b9f519d7d","Hmph! Words are empty without proof. Do you have any evidence?"
"13b02cb242e02f3832561580c07f8f03","Give me three days. I promise I'll get to the bottom of this."
"8f0a42d754e8e1e666af708a1e030507","Huh, interesting. And what if after three days you still have nothing?"
"7d40223e0989e73e6ada214845b7d6ca","Then you have my life at your disposal."
"fd08ba0ea3e0cb51d8ccd0fd318cbcb5","Very well, you have three days. By then, we'll have this settled. Farewell."
"cd2bfec23b71fb89d62df2eada4dcf11","He's the forthright sort. I have three days. Looks like the key remains within Bamboo Pond."
"8eec78669231969321032b2743a145e0","I'll do what I can, and let fate run its course."
"b21747d6e3726af7a70f697b004a178c","Hmph. Very well. Three days it is. We meet in three days' time. Farewell."

"7c64b854675a3f310625406a36a5963e","Huh. At least you're not a coward. I'll cripple your limbs today, and we're even. Stay away, or I won't be lenient."
"3c2866468ca0d4abc36000bfc1b316d1","Have some mercy. Spare me this once, and I'll repay you someday."
"a52e3eb51b50e3cd5c89c52f9288d9c0","Absurd! Did you ever think it would come down to this when you first framed me?"
"5e862aea3b3fe1d8dafd9860ae7a9195","Three days have passed. Time to give me an explanation!"
"e66f56c87a1c1b09649a13972d7fffca","I've got some information that might be useful to you."
"d868c32396eb6d5efb61f7e163167d88","Oh? Tell me about it."
"0ff08c995c7ca1d64d92d4f57abefa7a","Tell him about what you found."
"cfaf3320170ab14759b92c0e4e4cd4d7","I'll look into what you've said. Once I verify the facts, we'll meet again."
"01a8a4fbcacbf5e590a109a42d1c1d00","To think they brought in an outsider to frame me! Just who could it be..."

"f7b6e88523d0de8e2c3b4d687707bebd","Huh. You promised an explanation in three days, but you strung me along."
"9b3a50da86709f2b4cfdc05115a5e3a2","Enough talk. Show what you've got!"
"7fd651c9b20779b463e8e7e0c6c00150","It's not like that..."

"14796c95faad382c31ed5976ac16ef27","This village is called Tianping Village, with strange peaks standing like a terrace on the sky. More than a decade ago, the martial arts world was in chaos when the northern region moved south. The terrain here is special and easy to defend but difficult to attack. Fortunately, it was not disturbed by the wind and rain of the rivers and lakes, so our ancestors settled here and named it Tianping Village according to the place name."
"b90a655b41fe879166254b2734aa0f89","Tianping Village? It's really as its name suggests."
"712d37f4677c5a8777b438a4b2d9bf8c","Have you heard of Longquan Town?"
"a5192992955d0b10adcf4cc55a984f01","Longquan Town, that's a big place. It's called a town, but it has expanded over the years. It is already as good as some small towns. I was lucky enough to go there many years ago. It was bustling and prosperous, far beyond the comparison of Tianping Village. "
"bff216c8119edeaa93307c23e610293d","How to get to Longquan Town?"

"2f1f1d7521d59bede9c0bd12c1b8f742","Strange, I have been to Longquan Town, but I can't remember the way. I just remember that you have to go to more places."

"0cce75bb1b4994d66eea46aa77deddd5","Many years ago, the martial arts world in the Central Plains was still under the rule of <GuideRed>宏图千秋·皇朝主</>. Although the six ministries of the dynasty were strict and the imperial guards often did evil, it was generally peaceful."
"b544a91979527e862614ddb0e7991369","But a <GuideRed>千幻郎君</> suddenly appeared in the martial arts world, and he led a killer organization that constantly assassinated martial arts celebrities and senior officials of the six ministries, causing unrest in the martial arts world."

"723aab37b72c3cbab675214513b1ce25","The assassins were inhumane, not only targeting the imperial city, but also killing anyone they saw in the town. In the end, they fought with the six heads of the six tribes who accompanied the emperor for several days and nights, and the blood flowed like a river. "
"f3750d70ecd89052ed7c18a72cc36533","It is rumored that the bloody smell spread for several miles, and even the river water was dyed red. "

"14d950905bec6f713b76acab2765020b","But if you ask what big things happened in Longquan Town, this is probably what I have heard. "

"34bc7e8102e4d535771f8fcef2b9d3ce","But during the Grand Emperor's reign, everyone was fighting each other, even though the Emperor tried to keep things under control. During that time, there was this person named Yan Xiaosheng in the Six-Mile Longting. He was pretty interesting."

"472affdd7c80f8aba437063d3a9bf211","Yan Xiaosheng issued a challenge to all heroes, declaring that only those whose names are inscribed on the Cloud Monument can truly be called heroes.

"eda96daa669e50f7fbaed6d747303082","Well, the Cloud Monument is incredibly formidable. Not everyone can leave their mark on!

"7526d23ba5dee4c8dcd998220c793584","Then, a bunch of really powerful martial artists started fighting, and it was a huge mess. Driven by the desire for fame, they fought for days on end. The battle was so intense that even watching from afar was painful for those with weak Inner Kungfu."

About a hundred years ago, a legendary figure popped up here—his name's been forgotten, but he went on to do incredible things. He founded the Great Wilds Dynasty and brought together different factions into what we call the Six Ministries. That's why our town is now called Dragonspring, a place of new beginnings."
